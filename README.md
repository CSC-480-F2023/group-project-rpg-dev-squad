# The RPG Dev Squad
Welcome to the User Prompted Role-Playing Game.
In this project we intend to design a simple video game that allows users to explore an environment and engage in simple combat.

# Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide a fun experience for users while allowing ourselves to test our coding skills. 

# For Future Users
We will use this repository as a space where all of our code and analysis materials will be stored. Future pursuers of this project should find it easy to access all material that we used for this project as well as helpful notes that we discovered along the way.

# Contrubitors
This project is being created and maintained by Joel Seepersaud and Khalil Anderson. The advisor for this project is Professor Derek Munday. Joel and Khalil formulated the concept for this project and drafted it through the software development life cycle. Professor Munday serves as the regulator for the project and serves as a guide on the softwware development and planning.
