User Prompted Role-Playing Game

Group Members:

Problem statement:
We want to design a simple role-playing game (RPG) that allows the player to explore an environment and engage in simple combat and situations.

Project scope:
We intend to design a game with a simple world that allows a user to control a character and navigate their environment to pick up items and engage in combat with non-playable characters. For now we plan to do a prompt style game similar to “The Oregon Trail Game” or “Life”, where the game prompts the user to input data and then responds with their choices and displays a graphic if possible. We don’t intend on making the game too complex, but the details will be fleshed out as much as necessary to get the idea across.

Technologies:
We intend to use either Java or C++ for the coding of the game and its internal design elements as well as for world graphics and world.  

Project justification:
This project allows us to use a variety of different coding techniques that we have learned, as well as gives us the opportunity to learn more techniques and refine our skills in high level programming languages.


Roles:
Khalil: I would like to tackle aspects of the character design. I intend to handle aspects unique to the player character and NPCs such as their stats, appearance, dialogue, etc. 

Joel: I would like to handle the gameplay aspect. This will include in game items, item stats/abilities, graphical implementation, combat and exploration system, etc.
